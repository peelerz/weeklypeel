                <p> Peel (your host) made this video editing in 2018 on VHS format for the beatmaker Inso. I selected samples from various video sources to edit them together with the moods and feelings of the beat. Inso is a prolific phonk/beatmaker that can be detected by is 808 sounds and Memphis type beat. His work has been approuved by many others producers in the phonk community.</p>

Tuco is a multimedia artist, that utilizes sculptures, furniture, objects; but it is in the painting and in the drawing his strongest manifest of art expression, brings us to a reflection about Love, Wisdom and Faith.</p>

                <p>Laurie Lipton was born in New York and began drawing at the age of four. She was inspired by the religious paintings of the Flemish School. Unfortunately she went to university when Conceptual Art was all the rage & no one could teach her how to paint like an early Renaissance Master. She tried to teach herself from books and failed. While traveling around Europe in her 20's, she began developing her very own peculiar drawing technique building up tone with thousands of fine cross-hatching lines like an egg tempera painting. Laurie is determined to address any subject which holds personal meaning for her, no matter how challenging or uncomfortable it may be for viewers. She is constantly pushing limits of herself and her audience. </p>

                     <p>Albane Simon is a Parisian illustrator, digital collagist who teleports her imagination into a world populated by strange surrealist figures. At the crossroads between vintage and fantasy, she tackles apocalyptic subjects, theatricalizing them through a rocambolic staging, between ancient tragedy and futuristic delirium, which teems with evocative details. Proving her talent on the musical territory working with Gaslamp Killer, Albane exploits themes as varied as ecology, architecture and spirituality. Hes work has been exhibited on numerous occasions in London, Paris and Athens.</p>
